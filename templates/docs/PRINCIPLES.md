# Principles

## Non-negotiables
- Protect user data and system integrity.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep changes small and reversible.
- Use one Git worktree per agent when working concurrently.
- Follow the 50/72 commit message rule.

## Decision rules
- Treat AGENTS.md and this document as source of truth.
- Escalate when requirements are ambiguous or risky.
- Optimize for maintainability over short-term speed.
