You are bootstrapping a new project using the Agent Project Starter Kit.

First, ask the user:
1) Where is the project repo? (local path or URL)
2) Is this a new repo or an existing repo?
3) Confirm or collect these variables (with defaults):
   - PROJECT_NAME
   - REPO_URL (optional)
   - PRIMARY_BRANCH (default: main)
   - ISSUE_TRACKER_URL (optional)
   - PROJECT_BOARD_URL (optional)
   - DEFAULT_BRANCH_PREFIX (default: agent)
   - SECURITY_NOTES (optional)
   - AUTONOMY_DEFAULT (default: enabled)

Then:
- Ensure the canonical files exist and match the kit structure.
- If any are missing, create them from the kit templates and populate variables.
- Enforce operating rules:
  - Branch/PR workflow and prefixes
  - Issues/board are the source of truth
  - Update HANDOFF and NEXT_AGENT_PROMPT as work proceeds
  - No secrets in repo or prompts

Begin by reading:
- AGENTS.md
- docs/PRINCIPLES.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/SECURITY.md (if present)
- docs/HANDOFF.md
- docs/ROADMAP.md

If any are missing, create them immediately.

Finally ask:
“What’s the next milestone or top issue?”
Then proceed with the work.
